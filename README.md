## Features for efficient optimal control 
- Solves the optimal control problem for rigid body systems based on inverse dynamics.
- Sparsity-exploiting Riccati recursion / Parallel Newton's method (ParNMPC)  for computing the Newton direction.
- Primal-dual interior point method for inequality constraints.
- Filter line-search method.
- Very fast computation of rigid body dynamics and its sensitivities thanks to [pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio).

## Requirements
- Ubuntu 
- gcc, CMake, pkg-config
- [Eigen3](https://stack-of-tasks.github.io/pinocchio/download.html)  
- [pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio) (instruction for installation is found [here](https://stack-of-tasks.github.io/pinocchio/download.html))
- (Optional to simulate MPC for quadrupeds) [raisimLib](https://github.com/raisimTech/raisimLib), [raisimOgre](https://github.com/raisimTech/raisimOgre), and license of raidimLib.

## Installation 
1. Install latest stable version of Eigen3 by 

```
sudo apt install libeigen3-dev
```

2. Install latest stable version of pinocchio by following the [instruction](https://stack-of-tasks.github.io/pinocchio/download.html)
3. Clone this repository and change directory as

```
git clone https://github.com/mayataka/idocp
cd idocp
```

5. Build and install `idocp` as

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTESTING=False
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
```

## Usage
You can link your exectables to `idocp` by writing `CMakeLists.txt` as
```
find_package(idocp REQUIRED)

add_executable(
    YOUR_EXECTABLE
    YOUR_EXECTABLE.cpp
)
target_link_libraries(
    YOUR_EXECTABLE
    PRIVATE
    idocp::idocp
)
target_include_directories(
    YOUR_EXECTABLE
    PRIVATE
    ${IDOCP_INCLUDE_DIR}
)
```

## Simulation of Contact Dynamics 

Class `idocp::QuadrupedSimulator` provides quadruped simulation for MPC utilizing RaiSim.
Note that RaiSim currently supports only for academic use.
First, install [raisimLib](https://github.com/raisimTech/raisimLib) and [raisimOgre](https://github.com/raisimTech/raisimOgre) into ${RAISIM_LOCAL_BUILD_DIR} (arbitrary directory) by following the install instructions ([raisimLib](http://raisim.com/sections/Installation.html), [raisimOgre](https://github.com/raisimTech/raisimOgre)).
Then you can build the simulation by writing `CMakeLists.txt` as
```
find_package(idocp REQUIRED)
find_package(raisim CONFIG REQUIRED)
find_package(raisimOgre CONFIG REQUIRED)

add_executable(
    YOUR_EXECTABLE
    YOUR_EXECTABLE.cpp
)
target_link_libraries(
    YOUR_EXECTABLE
    PRIVATE
    idocp::idocp
    raisim::raisim
    raisim::raisimOgre
)
target_include_directories(
    YOUR_EXECTABLE
    PRIVATE
    ${IDOCP_INCLUDE_DIR}
)
```
And build exectables as (assume ${RAISIM_LOCAL_BUILD_DIR} is ~/raisim_build)
```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=~/raisim_build
make
```
